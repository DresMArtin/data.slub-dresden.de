Based on our linked data we decided we want to visualize some of the connections between our privided entities. In the step of the analysis it turned out that [topics](https://data.slub-dresden.de/topics/search) are quite promising. They are directly linked from our [resources](https://data.slub-dresden.de/resources/search) and thus are suitable for finding connections between different topics and how strong their context is with respect to each other. 

You can search and select a specific topic query and explore its topical surrounding. By clicking on another topic within the inner circle you are able to restrict the larger topic to occurances togehter with the additionally clicked topic. This together with a restriction for authors and contributors can be used to narrow down the search.


Finally, you can jump directly to our [catalog](https://katalog.slub-dresden.de){: .extlink} to view specific resources.
