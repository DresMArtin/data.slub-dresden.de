# How to query the API
The API is used through its endpoints. Depending on the task at hand some endpoints are better suited than others.

## Connect via OpenRefine reconciliation API
The endpoint [`/reconcile`]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link doc/api_endpoints/reconcile.md %}) can be used with Google's OpenRefine.

## Search for an entry
The endpoint [`/search`]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link doc/api_endpoints/search.md %}) provides an interface for searching through all resources
